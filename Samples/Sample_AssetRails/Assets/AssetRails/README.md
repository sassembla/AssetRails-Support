##AssetBundle Generator as a command line tool

Like this.

	/Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity -batchmode\
	 -quit -projectPath $(pwd)\
	 -executeMethod AssetRailsController.Bundlize


[command line args](https://github.com/sassembla/AssetRails-Support/blob/master/CommandLineArgs.md#assetrails-command-line-args)

##build pipeline
You can construct pipeline which called "route".

* import, prefabricate, bundlize, versioning.
* Run multiple routes in order.
Supported format is json & toml(experimental).

* AssetRails has Runner-API for each route.
You can programming it's runner.


##Web console & run Jenkins job
AssetRails has browser interface.

Also you can run Jenkins job from AssetRails Console if AssetRails contained project is under the Jenkins.



##folder format supported

also **.meta** files too.

##manage AssetBundles
###Generate AssetBundle-data-list by versioning.

versionedList.json

    {
        "versioned": 1,
        "AssetBundles": [
            {
                "bundleName": "characters_enemy.assetBundle",
                "revision": 1,
                "resourceNames": [
                    "texture",
                    "enemy_material",
                    "enemy_prefab"
                ],
                "size": 727140,
                "crc": 235040124
            },
            {
                "bundleName": "characters_hero.assetBundle",
                "revision": 1,
                "resourceNames": [
                    "texture",
                    "hero_material",
                    "hero_prefab"
                ],
                "size": 727140,
                "crc": 2232339018
            }
        ]
    }	

full example is in [Sample project](https://github.com/sassembla/AssetRails-Support/tree/master/Samples/AssetBundleReaderProject).

###fast multi platform bundlize & manage support 
Generate & hold versioned-AssetBundles for each platform.

###use inherited AssetBundles supported.
You can generate new versioned-AssetBundles group with old versioned-AssetBundles.

below example will generate new version 2 versiond-AssetBundles from version 1's AssetBundles and new AssetBundlse.

	/Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity -batchmode\
	 -quit -projectPath $(pwd)\
	 -executeMethod AssetRailsController.Versioning -v 2 -p iPhone\
	 -b 1

see [versioning in deep](https://github.com/sassembla/AssetRails-Support/blob/master/Versioning.md#versioning-in-deep).


#Future
* Unity5 is beta support. but You can use this Asset with Unity 5's new feature, maybe.
